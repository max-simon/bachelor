\chapter{Results}
In the first part of the project, we investigated the cause of the falling of FAK. Therefore, we want to begin the presentation of our results in \autoref{results:umbrella} with the main finding of these studies, namely that the falling is not due to an underestimation of the binding energy in \martini{}. Afterwards, we analyse the observations of FAK in solution to develop a reference state for later comparisons (\autoref{sec:fak_sol}). Before we consider FAK molecules on membranes, the applied stabilising force and its impact on used observables is examined in \autoref{forceana}. The investigation of FAK molecules on the membrane is split up into two parts. In \autoref{membrane:chapter}, the obtained conformational changes of FAK molecules bound to a \pip{}-containing membrane are presented. In the last section of this chapter, \autoref{multiProt}, the focus is then on interactions between multiple FAK molecules.
